What is fluids?
---------------

fluids is open-source software for engineers and technicians working in the
fields of chemical, mechanical, or civil engineering. It includes modules
for piping, fittings, pumps, tanks, compressible flow, open-channel flow,
and more.

The fluids library depends on the SciPy library to provide numerical constants,
interpolation, integration, and numerical solving functionality. fluids runs on
all operating systems which support Python, is quick to install, and is free
of charge. fluids is designed to be easy to use while still providing powerful
functionality. If you need to perform some fluid dynamics calculations, give
fluids a try.
