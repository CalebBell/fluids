Fittings pressure drop (fluids.fittings)
========================================

    .. meta::
      :description: Calculate loss coefficients for entrances, exits, bends, contractions, expansions and diffusers, tees, valves, and all the fittings in the Hooper 2K and Darby 3K methods. Also included are converters between loss coefficients and Cv/Kv; and lift velocity for check vales. The implemented methods come from Crane TP 410M, Rennels and Hudson (2012)'s guide, Miller's Internal Flow Systems, Idelâ€™chik's  Handbook of Hydraulic Resistance, and Blevins's Applied Fluid Dynamics Handbook.
