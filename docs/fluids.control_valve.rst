Control valve sizing and rating (fluids.control_valve)
======================================================

    .. meta::
      :description: Python module for rating and sizing Control Valves. Contains functions implementing IEC 60534-8-4 (2015) and IEC 60534-8-3 (2011) which calculate the noise generated by a control valve as well. Utility functions for calculating Cavivation Index and converting flow coefficients Cv, Kv, and Av between each other are implemented too. Both choked and non-choked valves are covered by these functions.
