Compressible flow and compressor sizing (fluids.compressible)
=============================================================

    .. meta::
      :description: Model a compressor, or compressible flow in a pipe with this Python module! For compressors, both polytropic and adiabatic models are included. For pipe flow, a rigorous model as well as the most common empirical models such as Panhandle A, Panhandle B, Weymouth, Spitzglass, Oliphant and Fritzsche flow equations are included and documented here.
