    # This job publishes to PyPI when a GitHub release is created with a tag starting with 'v' on the release branch.
    #
    # Requirements:
    # - Repository admin must create a release with a tag starting with 'v' (e.g., v1.2.3)
    # - The tag must be created on the 'release' branch
    # - The release branch is protected by rulesets requiring all changes go through PR review
    #
    # Security notes:
    # - The tag and branch checks in this job are soft checks (can be bypassed by modifying workflow)
    # - Real security enforcement comes from the 'pypi' environment which requires manual approval by org admin
    # - This provides a final gate before any code is published to PyPI
