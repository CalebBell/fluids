def isothermal_work_compression(P1, P2, T, Z=1.0):
    r'''Calculates the work of compression or expansion of a gas going through
    an isothermal process.

    .. math::
        W = zRT\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)

    Parameters
    ----------
    P1 : float
        Inlet pressure, [Pa]
    P2 : float
        Outlet pressure, [Pa]
    T : float
        Temperature of the gas going through an isothermal process, [K]
    Z : float
        Constant compressibility factor of the gas, [-]

    Returns
    -------
    W : float
        Work performed per mole of gas compressed/expanded [J/mol]

    Notes
    -----
    The full derivation with all forms is as follows:

    .. math::
        W = \int_{P_1}^{P_2} V dP = zRT\int_{P_1}^{P_2} \frac{1}{P} dP

    .. math::
        W = zRT\ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right) = P_1 V_1 \ln\left(\frac{P_2}
        {P_1}\right) = P_2 V_2 \ln\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}\right)

    The substitutions are according to the ideal gas law with compressibility:

    .. math:
        PV = ZRT

    The work of compression/expansion is the change in enthalpy of the gas.
    Returns negative values for expansion and positive values for compression.

    An average compressibility factor can be used where Z changes. For further
    accuracy, this expression can be used repeatedly with small changes in
    pressure and the work from each step summed.

    This is the best possible case for compression; all actual compresssors
    require more work to do the compression.

    By making the compression take a large number of stages and cooling the gas
    between stages, this can be approached reasonable closely. Integrally
    geared compressors are often used for this purpose.

def isentropic_work_compression(T1, k, Z=1.0, P1=None, P2=None, W=None, eta=None):
    r'''Calculation function for dealing with compressing or expanding a gas
    going through an isentropic, adiabatic process assuming constant Cp and Cv.
    The polytropic model is the same equation; just provide `n` instead of `k`
    and use a polytropic efficiency for `eta` instead of a isentropic
    efficiency. Can calculate any of the following, given all the other inputs:

    * W, Work of compression
    * P2, Pressure after compression
    * P1, Pressure before compression

    Parameters
    ----------

    P1 : float, optional
        Inlet pressure, [Pa]
    P2 : float, optional
        Outlet pressure, [Pa]
    W : float, optional
        Work performed per mole of gas compressed/expanded [J/mol]
    eta : float, optional
        Isentropic efficiency of the process or polytropic efficiency of the
        process to use this as a polytropic model instead [-]

    Returns
    -------
    W, P1, P2, or eta : float
        The missing input which was solved for [base SI]

    Notes
    -----
    For the same compression ratio, this is always of larger magnitude than the
    isothermal case.

    The full derivation is as follows:

    For constant-heat capacity "isentropic" fluid,

    .. math::
        V = \frac{P_1^{1/k}V_1}{P^{1/k}}

    .. math::
        W = \int_{P_1}^{P_2} V dP = \int_{P_1}^{P_2}\frac{P_1^{1/k}V_1}
        {P^{1/k}}dP

    .. math::
        W = \frac{P_1^{1/k} V_1}{1 - \frac{1}{k}}\left[P_2^{1-1/k} -
        P_1^{1-1/k}\right]

    After performing the integration and substantial mathematical manipulation
    we can obtain:

    .. math::
        W = \left(\frac{k}{k-1}\right) P_1 V_1 \left[\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}
        \right)^{(k-1)/k}-1\right]

    Using PV = ZRT:

    .. math::
        W = \left(\frac{k}{k-1}\right)ZRT_1\left[\left(\frac{P_2}{P_1}
        \right)^{(k-1)/k}-1\right]

    The work of compression/expansion is the change in enthalpy of the gas.
    Returns negative values for expansion and positive values for compression.

    An average compressibility factor should be used as Z changes. For further
    accuracy, this expression can be used repeatedly with small changes in
    pressure and new values of isentropic exponent, and the work from each step
    summed.

    For the polytropic case this is not necessary, as `eta` corrects for the
    simplification.

    A variety of forms of this equation have been presented, differing in their

    Returns
    -------
    m, P1, P2, D, or L : float
        The missing input which was solved for [base SI]

    Notes
    -----
    The solution for P2 has the following closed form, derived using Maple:

    .. math::
        P_2={P_1 \left( {{ e}^{0.5\cdot{\frac {1}{{m}^{2}} \left( -C{m}^{2}
        +\text{ lambertW} \left(-{\frac {BP_1}{{m}^{2}}{{ e}^{-{\frac {-C{m}^{
        2}+BP_1}{{m}^{2}}}}}}\right){}{m}^{2}+BP_1 \right) }}} \right) ^{-1}}

    .. math::
       B = \frac{\pi^2 D^4}{4^2} \rho_{avg}

    .. math::
       C = f_d \frac{L}{D}

    A wide range of conditions are impossible due to choked flow. See
    `P_isothermal_critical_flow` for details. An exception is raised when
    they occur.

    The 2 multiplied by the logarithm is often shown  as a power of the
    pressure ratio; this is only the case when the pressure ratio is raised to
    the power of 2 before its logarithm is taken.

    A number of limitations exist for this model:

        * Density dependence is that of an ideal gas.
        * If calculating the pressure drop, the average gas density cannot
          be known immediately; iteration must be used to correct this.
        * The friction factor depends on both the gas density and velocity,
          so it should be solved for iteratively as well. It changes throughout
          the pipe as the gas expands and velocity increases.
        * The model is not easily adapted to include elevation effects due to
          the acceleration term included in it.
        * As the gas expands, it will change temperature slightly, further
          altering the density and friction factor.

    There are many commercial packages which perform the actual direct
    integration of the flow, such as OLGA Dynamic Multiphase Flow Simulator,
    or ASPEN Hydraulics.

    This expression has also been presented with the ideal gas assumption
    directly incorporated into it [4]_ (note R is the specific gas constant, in
    units of J/kg/K):

    .. math::
        \dot m^2 = \frac{\left(\frac{\pi D^2}{4}\right)^2
        \left(P_1^2-P_2^2\right)}{RT\left(f_d\frac{L}{D} + 2\ln\frac{P_1}{P_2}
        \right)}

    The form in [2]_ has the same exponents as used here, units of mm
    (diameter), kPa, km (length), and flow in m^3/hour; its leading constant is

    It is in units of mm (diameter) and kPa and m^3/day; length is stated to be
    in km, but according to the errata is in m.

    [4]_ has a leading constant of 1.198E7, a specific gravity of power of 0.8541,
    and a power of diameter which is under the root of 4.854 and is otherwise
    the same. It has units of kPa and m^3/day, but is otherwise in base SI
    units.

    [5]_ has a leading constant of 99.5211, but its reference correction has no

    units.

    [6]_ has pressures in psi, diameter in inches, length in miles, Q in

    Notes
    -----
    [1]_'s original constant was 1.002E-2, and it has units of km (length),
    kPa, mm (diameter), and flowrate in m^3/day.

    The form in [2]_ has the same exponents as used here, units of mm
    (diameter), kPa, km (length), and flow in m^3/hour; its leading constant is
    4.1749E-4.

    The GPSA [3]_ has a leading constant of 0.339, and otherwise the same constants.
    It is in units of mm (diameter) and kPa and m^3/day; length is stated to be
    in km, but according to the errata is in m.

    [4]_ has a leading constant of 1.264E7, a diameter power of 4.961 which is
    also under the 0.51 power, and is otherwise the same. It has units of kPa
    and m^3/day, but is otherwise in base SI units.

    [5]_ has a leading constant of 135.8699, but its reference correction has
    no exponent and its specific gravity has a power of 0.9608; the other
    exponents are the same as here. It is entirely in base SI units.

    [6]_ has pressures in psi, diameter in inches, length in miles, Q in
    ft^3/day, T in degrees Rankine, and a constant of 737 with the exponents
    the same as here.

    Notes
    -----
    This equation is often presented without any correction for reference
    conditions for specific gravity.

    This model is also presented in [2]_ with a leading constant of 5.69E-2,
    the same exponents as used here, units of mm  (diameter), kPa, km (length),
    and flow in m^3/hour. However, it is believed to contain a typo, and gives
    results <1/3 of the correct values. It is also present in [2]_ in imperial
    form; this is believed correct, but makes a slight assumption not done in
    [1]_.

    This model is present in [3]_ without reference corrections. The 1210
    constant in [1]_ is an approximation necessary for the reference correction
    to function without a square of the pressure difference. The GPSA version
    is as follows, and matches this formulation very closely:

    .. math::
        Q = 0.821 \left[\frac{(P_1-P_2)D^5}{L \cdot {SG}
        (1 + 91.44/D + 0.0018D)}\right]^{0.5}

    The model is also shown in [4]_, with diameter in inches, length in feet,
    flow in MMSCFD, pressure drop in inH2O, and a rounded leading constant of
    0.09; this makes its predictions several percent higher than the model here.
