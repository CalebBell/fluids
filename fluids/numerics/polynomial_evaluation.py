def horner(coeffs, x):
    r'''Evaluates a polynomial defined by coefficienfs `coeffs` at a specified
    scalar `x` value, using the horner method. This is the most efficient
    formula to evaluate a polynomial (assuming non-zero coefficients for all
    terms). This has been added to the `fluids` library because of the need to
    frequently evaluate polynomials; and `NumPy`'s polyval is actually quite
    slow for scalar values.

    Note that the coefficients are reversed compared to the common form; the
    first value is the coefficient of the highest-powered x term, and the last
    value in `coeffs` is the constant offset value.

    Parameters
    ----------
    coeffs : iterable[float]
        Coefficients of polynomial, [-]
    x : float
        Point at which to evaluate the polynomial, [-]

    Returns
    -------
    val : float
        The evaluated value of the polynomial, [-]

    Notes
    -----
    For maximum speed, provide a list of Python floats and `x` should also be
    of type `float` to avoid either `NumPy` types or slow python ints.

    Compare the speed with numpy via:

    >>> coeffs = np.random.uniform(0, 1, size=15)
    >>> coeffs_list = coeffs.tolist()

    %timeit np.polyval(coeffs, 10.0)

    `np.polyval` takes on the order of 15 us; `horner`, 1 us.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> horner([1.0, 3.0], 2.0)
    5.0
