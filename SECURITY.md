# Security Policy

This project doesn't really do anything that could be a security issue. It is simply a library. Using it is left to the user.

## Supported Versions

The development of fluids is linear at this time; upgrade fluids to the latest version to obtain any security fixes, in the event that there ever are any.

## Automated Security Scanning

This project has the following automated security scanning tools setup via GitHub Actions:

- **pip-audit**: Scans dependencies for known security vulnerabilities
- **bandit**: Performs static analysis to identify common security issues in Python code

It is not expected any vulnerabilities would be found on a library used for calculations.
The inclusion of scanners is a general best practice, not an indication of concern.
